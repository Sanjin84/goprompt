# Members Area

This is an explanation of the provided code. The code consists of an HTML file and a JavaScript file. The HTML file creates a Members Area page, and the JavaScript file contains the logic for managing prompts and tabs.

## HTML File

### DOCTYPE, html, and head tags

The HTML file starts with a DOCTYPE declaration, followed by an html tag with a language attribute set to "en" (English). The head tag contains essential meta tags, a title tag, a link to a stylesheet, a script tag to load Google's platform.js library, and a script tag that initializes the Google Auth API.

### body tag

The body tag contains the following elements:

1. A nav element that includes links to Home and Public pages, and a Sign Out button.
2. Add Tab, Save Prompt Collection, and Publish Prompt Collection buttons.
3. A div element with a class of "tabs" that contains two child elements: an unordered list with an id of "tab-links" and a div with an id of "tab-content".
4. A Copy All button.
5. A script tag that links to an external JavaScript file (myprompt.js).

## JavaScript File

### Variables

The JavaScript file starts by declaring variables that store DOM elements and initializing an async function called `fetchPrompts()` to fetch prompts from a server.

### Functions

The file contains several functions:

1. `fetchPrompts()`: An async function that fetches prompts from the server and returns them as a JSON object.
2. `savePrompts()`: An async function that saves prompts to the server.
3. `createPrompt()`: A function that creates a new prompt in a specified tab with a given title and text.
4. `displayPrompts()`: An async function that fetches prompts, creates empty tabs, switches to the first tab, and adds the prompts to their respective tabs.
5. `switchTab()`: A function that switches to a specified tab.
6. `editTabName()`: A function that edits a tab's name.
7. `deleteTab()`: A function that deletes a specified tab.
8. `createTab()`: A function that creates a new tab with a given name.
9. `addPromptToTab()`: A function that adds a new prompt to a specified tab.
10. `getNextTabId()`: A function that gets the next available tab ID.
11. `copyAllPrompts()`: A function that copies all prompts in the active tab to the clipboard.
12. `signOut()`: A function that signs out the user and redirects them to the home page.
13. `askForTitleAndName()`: A function that prompts the user for a collection title and their name.
14. `fetchPromptsToSave()`: A function that fetches prompts to be saved.
15. `savePublicPrompts()`: An async function that saves public prompts to the server.

### Event Listeners

The file also contains several event listeners:

1. Click event listeners for the Save Prompt Collection and Add Tab buttons.
2. Click event listeners for tab links and delete icons within tab links.
3. Double-click event listeners for tab links to edit tab names.
4. A DOMContentLoaded event listener that initializes the app when the page is loaded.

### Modification

A modification to the `copyAllPrompts()` function is provided to copy all prompts in the active tab to the clipboard. This function is called when the Copy All button is clicked.
